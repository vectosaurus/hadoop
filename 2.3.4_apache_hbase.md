# Apache HBase
- Apache HBase™ is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.


#### Difference between HBase and HDFS
- HDFS is a distributed file system that is well suited for the storage of large files. Its documentation states that it is not, however, a general purpose file system, and does not provide fast individual record lookups in files. HBase, on the other hand, is built on top of HDFS and provides fast record lookups (and updates) for large tables. This can sometimes be a point of conceptual confusion. HBase internally puts your data in indexed "StoreFiles" that exist on HDFS for high-speed lookups
- HDFS is a Java based distributed file system that allows you to store large data across multiple nodes in a Hadoop cluster. Whereas HBase is a NoSQL database (similar as NTFS and MySQL).
- HDFS is fault-tolerant by design and supports rapid data transfer between nodes even during system failures. HBase is a non-relational and open source Not-Only-SQL database that runs on top of Hadoop (MapReduce + HDFS). HBase comes under CP type of CAP (Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance) theorem.
- HDFS is most suitable for performing batch analytics. However, one of its biggest drawbacks is its inability to perform real-time analysis, the trending requirement of the IT industry. HBase, on the other hand, can handle large data sets and is not appropriate for batch analytics. Instead, it is used to write/read data from Hadoop in real-time.
- Both HDFS and HBase are capable of processing structured, semi-structured as well as un-structured data. HDFS lacks an in-memory processing engine slowing down the process of data analysis; as it is using plain old MapReduce to do it. HBase, on the contrary, boasts of an in-memory processing engine that drastically increases the speed of read/write.
- HDFS is very transparent in its execution of data analysis.  HBase, on the other hand, being a NoSQL database in tabular format, fetches values by sorting them under different key values.
- HDFS is a Java-based file system utilized for storing large data sets.	HBase is a Java based Not Only SQL database
- HDFS has a rigid architecture that does not allow changes. It doesn’t facilitate dynamic storage.	HBase allows for dynamic changes and can be utilized for standalone applications.
- HDFS is ideally suited for write-once and read-many times use cases	HBase is ideally suited for random write and read of data that is stored in HDFS.
