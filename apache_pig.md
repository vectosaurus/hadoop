2. Pig Latin: Pig's language. Lets you specify a sequence of data transformations such as merging data sets, filtering them, and applying functions to records or groups of records
3. Pig execution environment: Local, MapReduce, Tez
4. In built operators and functions
5. Extensible
6. Pig Latin programs run in a distributed fashion on a cluster (programs are complied into Map/Reduce jobs and executed using Hadoop). For quick prototyping, Pig Latin programs can also run in "local mode" without a cluster (all processing takes place in a single local JVM)
